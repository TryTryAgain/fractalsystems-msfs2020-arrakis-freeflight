# MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap

This is a companion to the <https://flightsim.to/file/76046/dune-challenges-without-challenges> "Training Missions" release...

- It includes all of the POIs from the Dune/Arrakis Challenges.
  - Desert Run
  - Race to Arrakis
  - Mountain Dive
  - Hole-in-the-Rock
  - Canyon Rush
  - Coriolis Storm Escape
- It also includes/will include any discoverables/interesting POIs
  - Currently only one "Random/Unknown Landing Pad #1", can you find more?

Happy Hunting!

If you are a perfectionist and would like to help others who are OCD about placement and would like to contribute back any corrections, I would gladly accept/implement anything like that. Thanks!

If you find anything new and exciting please let me know and I will add it and credit you!

## Installation

- Download and extract the zip
- Open Little Navmap
- Select "Userpoints" from the top toolbar and select "Import CSV"
- Navigate to the path where you extracted the "MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap" CSV
- Enjoy!

## Upgrade

When a new MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap version comes out you will do pretty much the same as Installation above but you will want to avoid duplicates, to avoid duplicates you can either:

### (Preferred method) Clean out existing before importing new version manually

- From the Search Window (Window -> Dock Windows -> Search)
  - Choose Userpoints tab
  - Filter only POI
  - Find all MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap related POIs, easier now with the 'MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap' tag
  - Select all and Delete Userpoints

### Or Cleanup Userpoints/remove duplicates after importing, via the Userpoints cleanup tool

- This may take a very long time with LNM not responding
- I definitely recommend doing preview first
- Userpoints (from the top toolbar) -> Cleanup Userpoints
  - Deselect/uncheck the "Delete userpoints having no information except coordinates and type."
  - Select only "Ident, Name, and Type", "Tags", and "Coordinates (similar)" and recommended to have "Show a preview before deleting userpoints"
  - Once you are happy with what it will do you can delete the duplicates/results

- Please let me know if there is a better/easier/more straightforward way to avoid duplicates when performing subsequent imports.
