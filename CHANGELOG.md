## [1.1.3] - 2024-06-20

Hotfix - Nested folder issue with the zip, sorry about that...

Additional Notes:
...sorry for the subsequent hotfix, didn't realize how it had nested the folder in the zip I uploaded and that caused an issue with being able to extract (at least for me).

If you happen to be a WindSailor user, I had additional issues:
You may need to go to the hamburger menu in the top right -> Open Settings -> Edit saved package's custom installation folders -> Wait for it to load/Scroll to the bottom and Delete "dune-challenges-without-challenges" ... Also delete the files/folders from that location. Not sure if that was because of the added 'fractalsystems-poi-dunearrakis' addon/folder or what, hope it doesn't have issues in future updates.

## [1.1.2] - 2024-06-20

Download v1.1.3 instead, the v1.1.2 has been removed as it had a nested folder issue with the zip

### Added

- Any discoverables/interesting POIs
  - Found another Landing Pad, added as "Random/Unknown Landing Pad #2", was this a part of a potential scene that didn't make the cut? Can you find more?
- Added a new `fractalsystems-poi-dunearrakis` folder/addon that will include any newly found discoverables/interesting POIs not directly related to the Challenges (currently includes "Random/Unknown Landing Pad #1" and "Random/Unknown Landing Pad #2")
  - This will allow for teleporting directly to them based on their name

### Changed

- Moved the MSFS-Dune-Arrakis-POI-LittleNavMap contents into its own folder
